## Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary
## Description: When two young American Jews raised to support Israel unconditionally witness the way Israel treats Palestinians, it changes their lives. They join a movement of young American Jews campaigning to redefine Judaism’s relationship with Israel and reveal a deepening generational divide over modern Jewish identity. Israelism sparked huge debate on American campuses even before the events of October 7, 2023.

It follows Simone Zimmerman, who visited Israel as a teenager, and Eitan who joined the Israeli army after graduating from high school as they discover the reality for Palestinians and radically revise their views. It includes interviews with academics and political activists, including Noam Chomsky, Cornel West, Lara Friedman and a former director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abe Foxman.

Contributors suggest the narrative that young American Jews are fed almost entirely erases the existence of the Palestinians through education and advocacy, sometimes involving groups that organise free trips to Israel partially funded by the Israeli government. 

This film describes how influential this narrative is in shaping attitudes to Israel, not just in the United States but across the world.

| <center>Iq6J7Q6L0yw Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary</center> | Currency   |  90%         | The video was uploaded on Nov 15, 2023, making it very recent.   |
| <center>Iq6J7Q6L0yw Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary</center> | Relevance  | 95%         | The video is highly relevant to anyone seeking a better understanding of the Israeli/Palestinian situation, the experience of young American Jews, and/or political issues around Zionism. It has been a contentious topic since release, per the description. |
| <center>Iq6J7Q6L0yw Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary</center> | Authority  | 70% | The video is produced by Aljazeera, a known media outlet, and features many interviewed voices (0:59, 1:49, 2:20)  including academics, political figures and activists in their fields. This lends some level of authority to the statements.  While Al Jazeera is based in Qatar it is a professional news organization.  However, one should also be aware that some have perceived the news organization as having an anti-Israel bias.|
| <center>Iq6J7Q6L0yw Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary</center> | Accuracy  |  60%         |The video is a documentary and presents a narrative of two people whose views have changed. The video supports the narrative with various interviews, b-roll and other visual cues, but as always, one should be aware that this is from a stated and specific perspective, and care should be taken to get various viewpoints. The content can be seen to be accurate for the perspectives shown. The footage shows various historical and current images. The claim about some trips to Israel being partly funded by the Israeli government [0:29] is a claim, the accuracy of which is not independently verified or validated in this film, but is from a statement made by the interviewees. The film makers do not provide independent citations, and this claim, while likely, is not without bias. The film makers do state at 2:28, "We like you, but we don't like Palestinians". The truthfulness of this quote, and the tone behind it, can be seen as accurate for the person who is being described.
| <center>Iq6J7Q6L0yw Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews | Featured Documentary</center> | Purpose   |  70%         | The purpose is to educate viewers about a movement by some young American Jews questioning their relationship with Israel and the narrative they were raised with. It is presented with an Aljazeera perspective, and should be seen to be giving a perspective, rather than being an objective portrayal of all sides. The film description does state that this documentary has "sparked huge debate", [0:00] and so this suggests the film itself is probably intended to be partisan. The interviews, statements and footage, while shown to be from a specific perspective, do seem to be truthful within their specific context, and the narrative of the film. The purpose is also to present a narrative that is critical of mainstream views about Israel and the military's conduct in the occupied territories.  It is likely to persuade viewers that traditional views of Israel are in some ways not necessarily correct or complete. |

<hr>

Summary of Truthfulness
The video presents a specific perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and specifically focuses on the journeys of two Jewish-Americans whose views have changed in their understanding of Israel. It supports its narrative with many interviews, b-roll and visual cues, from those on one side of the issue. It is a documentary and should be seen to be giving a perspective, rather than being an objective portrayal of all sides, and is presented with a bias that the military and the Israeli state have committed excesses. The information it presents appears generally truthful for the specific circumstances being shown, but should be viewed while understanding that it is not necessarily presenting all sides of the story.

| Deceptive | 10% |

### Validation and Verification

| Source/Statement | Time | Reasoning |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Claim about partially Israeli-funded free trips | 0:29 | The video does not provide a specific source for this claim, making independent verification difficult. It is a claim made by interviewees. It does make sense that some trips may be subsidized by the Israeli government to encourage young people to become more supportive of the state. |
| Statement, "We like you, but we don't like Palestinians" | 2:28 | This quote, while presented without reference, is spoken by an interviewee, and is therefore likely to reflect the mindset of the person who said this in this specific instance, while clearly not being universally true for all people. |
| Claim, that the Jewish-American community is fed almost entirely a narrative that erases Palestinians | 1:00 - 2:27 | The video does have numerous references to the promotion of the Israeli cause through education and advocacy. The various footage clips, interviews and statements show a concerted effort to create a strong sense of connection and commitment to Israel for young Jewish people, and this can be seen to be from a specific perspective. |
| Use of stock and b-roll footage of celebrations and military activites | 0:05 - 0:24, 1:11 - 1:21 | This imagery is used to show, what the video considers to be the excesses of promotion of a certain view about Israel, and that the military is a desirable goal. These images, while not showing anything particularly negative, can be viewed to be giving a specific perspective and should be understood as partisan. |
| Various Interviews throughout the documentary | Various time codes. | The interviews are with academics, political activists and others involved in the conflict, and are given from their particular viewpoint. All interviews do come from specific individuals, and not from a balanced mix of perspectives, and so the viewer is encouraged to obtain other sources of information to make up their own minds about the information presented.
| Historical footage, photos of settlements and military activity. | Various time codes. | The historical footage, photos, and animations shown are designed to help support the viewpoint and narrative of the documentary, and should be understood as such. They are real footage and photos, and the animations are symbolic rather than a literal description of events, but should be understood as used to support a particular narrative. |

### Tools and Recommendations

- **Snopes.com**: Useful for checking specific claims in the documentary, although it can often only focus on specifics, rather than analyzing an entire documentary.
- **Allsides.com**: This site could be used to analyze different perspectives and biases. In this particular case, while Allsides does have Al Jazeera listed, it did not have anything that specifically related to this media item. It can also show how different media outlets view Al Jazeera as well.
- **Wikipedia**: While Wikipedia is an open encyclopedia that anyone can contribute to and so is open to bias, it is often a good place to start to get background information and citations. However, Wikipedia pages on Israel or Palestine can often be very heavily edited, and the information therein, though generally truthful, may not be unbiased.
- **Youtube Channel analysis** Analyzing the Aljazeera channel can give an understanding of their general approach and biases.
- **Independent Research**: It can always help to research the interviews given in any documentary and to see where they have had viewpoints published before. Looking at different sources and interpretations can also help build a better overall picture of the subject matter.
- **Alternative Media Outlets:** Seek out both Israeli and Palestinian perspectives on the topics raised, to get a broader understanding, and then come to your own truthfulness conclusion.

### Video Description
When two young American Jews raised to support Israel unconditionally witness the way Israel treats Palestinians, it changes their lives. They join a movement of young American Jews campaigning to redefine Judaism’s relationship with Israel and reveal a deepening generational divide over modern Jewish identity. Israelism sparked huge debate on American campuses even before the events of October 7, 2023.

It follows Simone Zimmerman, who visited Israel as a teenager, and Eitan who joined the Israeli army after graduating from high school as they discover the reality for Palestinians and radically revise their views. It includes interviews with academics and political activists, including Noam Chomsky, Cornel West, Lara Friedman and a former director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abe Foxman.

Contributors suggest the narrative that young American Jews are fed almost entirely erases the existence of the Palestinians through education and advocacy, sometimes involving groups that organise free trips to Israel partially funded by the Israeli government. 

This film describes how influential this narrative is in shaping attitudes to Israel, not just in the United States but across the world.

### Overall Summary of Truthfulness
The documentary "Israelism: The awakening of young American Jews" presents a compelling narrative centered on the experiences of two young American Jews who have changed their views about Israel and the Palestinian conflict. The film is produced by Al Jazeera and includes a wide range of interviews and footage supporting the overall thesis, that the state of Israel's actions have led to great hardship for the Palestinian people. While the documentary is largely truthful in the accounts and stories it presents, it should be viewed with an understanding that it is providing a particular perspective, that is critical of the Israeli state and its military actions. 

The film makers present a bias that the Israeli military and the Israeli state have committed excesses and is critical of traditional views about Israel and the military's conduct in the occupied territories. It is designed to persuade viewers that traditional views of Israel may not be entirely correct, or complete.

The film makers have included interviews with various academics and activists on the subject, and the film is relatively recent, being published in 2023. The documentary and the statements within seem credible. The information is accurate for the specific circumstances and perspectives shown. However, care should be taken to obtain a wider understanding from various viewpoints, and to use other research tools to validate the claims and statements made.

Overall, the documentary is a credible source for the narrative it presents, but it should not be seen as a balanced portrayal of all sides of this complex issue.
