The buzz for Ivermectin as a possible treatment for acute coronavirus is becoming stronger every day - but how convincing is the actual evidence from clinical trials to date? And what are we to make of the one study done with Long Haulers that claimed a 94% success rate in complete resolution of symptoms? Could this be the wonder drug to treat hundreds of thousands of chronically ill people around the world? I search for the answers.

# VerityIndex Analysis

| MediaName | MetricType | MetricScore | Reasoning |
| ------------- |-------------| -----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| &lt;center&gt;gfeUPbbEnGc Ivermectin: The Wonder Drug for Long Covid?&lt;/center&gt; | Currency | 90% | The video was uploaded in 2021, making it reasonably current in terms of the ongoing research presented within. [0:26] The video refers to the discovery of Ivermectin in 1975. The Lancet study is from 2021 [1:12], the Dr Hansen review in early 2021 [1:40], and the Andrew Hill review in late 2020 [1:47]. |
| &lt;center&gt;gfeUPbbEnGc Ivermectin: The Wonder Drug for Long Covid?&lt;/center&gt; | Relevance | 95% | The topic is highly relevant to the stated title, and to the question of Ivermectin for both Acute Covid and Long Covid,  a topic of concern for many people.  The stated objective of searching for answers related to this drug is pertinent [0:00]. The video clearly defines the aims in the first minute, and follows this through. The focus on Long-covid treatment and the efficacy of the drug, is an important issue for those suffering from that chronic ailment. |
| &lt;center&gt;gfeUPbbEnGc Ivermectin: The Wonder Drug for Long Covid?&lt;/center&gt; | Authority | 85% | The presenter references several medical studies and experts, providing supporting evidence [1:12][1:40][1:47]. The presenter, although not specifically a medical expert, attempts to gather all relevant research and collate these into a summary. The references include Dr. Mike Hansen, an Internal Medicine specialist and Dr Andrew Hill, a researcher at Liverpool University [1:40, 1:47]. Wikipedia is a poor general source [0:26], but the presenter clearly provides other high authority sources to support this. |
| &lt;center&gt;gfeUPbbEnGc Ivermectin: The Wonder Drug for Long Covid?&lt;/center&gt; | Accuracy | 75% | The video accurately presents evidence from existing research, though it could be improved with additional critical analysis of the referenced studies. At [0:44] studies show antiviral effects. The video is balanced in its presentation. At [1:12] a Lancet study showing limited clinical evidence for Ivermectin in COVID-19 is mentioned. And a meta study [1:51] showing some promising results for acute COVID. The video also shows at [2:30] the only Long COVID study with a high resolution rate of 94%, but notes that it is a pre-print.  The video notes it is not a full literature review [1:36]. There is no presentation of alternative studies, which are numerous, which show no effect or harm from Ivermectin, which may skew the truth slightly. |
| &lt;center&gt;gfeUPbbEnGc Ivermectin: The Wonder Drug for Long Covid?&lt;/center&gt; | Purpose | 90% | The primary purpose is to explore whether Ivermectin is effective against Long COVID, the video seeks to understand evidence, which is primarily scientific and fact based. [0:00] The video is designed to inform the public about a potential treatment, not to promote Ivermectin, or sell a specific product.  It is not biased in its presentation of the research. The video makes a specific caveat at [1:36], that it is not a full literature review, showing it is open and honest about its content. It clearly states its conclusion at [6:18] that it is probably not a wonder drug for long Covid. The purpose seems to be truth, and not bias. |

&lt;br&gt;

### Summary of Truthfulness
The video is a good presentation of available research, showing a mostly objective perspective. The presenter has looked at various studies and expert views. The content is accurate in the claims and sources cited. However, this is not a complete study review. The video makes some strong claims that are not fully substantiated with critical analysis. The main detraction is that it is not complete and does not have the alternative view of studies that did not show a positive outcome. Therefore the information is mostly balanced, and credible, but not complete.

### Recommendations for Further Metrics

It might be interesting to investigate the following
1. A sentiment analysis of the comments for the video, to ascertain the general public opinion on the drug and the video content.
2. A cross comparison with other videos on the topic, to ascertain how the video scores against its peers.
3. A comparison to the view counts of other videos and the topic of view counts, for a popularity metric.
4. A review of other studies not referenced in this video, to get a broader opinion on the state of research on the topic.
