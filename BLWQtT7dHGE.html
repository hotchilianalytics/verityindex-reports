Ivermectin

https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/ivermectin.html#indicationsAndDoses

Invitro antiviral activity

Against a broad range of viruses

HIV, dengue, influenza, Zika virus

Invitro antiviral, SARS-CoV-2 activity

99.8% reduction in viral RNA after 48 h

Worldwide use for treating COVID-19

About 3.7 billion doses of ivermectin have been distributed globally over the past 30 years

EVMS CRITICAL CARE COVID-19 MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL 

https://www.evms.edu/media/evms_public/departments/internal_medicine/EVMS_Critical_Care_COVID-19_Protocol.pdf

Preexposure prophylaxis in high-risk patients

Postexposure prophylaxis

Symptomatic patients at home

Mildly symptomatic patients in hospital 

Progressive Respiratory symptoms
 
Ivermectin has emerged as the “wonder drug” to prophylaxis and treat COVID-19

Ivermectin inhibits viral replication and has potent anti-inflammatory properties 

There is the potential for serious drug-drug interaction

Additional, studies are urgently required to confirm these very impressive preliminary findings

Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19  (7th December)

https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-Ivermectin-in-the-prophylaxis-and-treatment-of-COVID-19.pdf

Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) 

One Sentence Summary 

Review of recently available clinical trial results demonstrating efficacy of ivermectin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. 

Use of Ivermectin Is Associated With Lower Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019

The ICON Study (October 2020, South Florida)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550891/

Research Question

Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients?

Study Design and Methods

Consecutive patients hospitalized

Four hospitals in Florida

Confirmed COVID-19 

March 15 and May 11, 2020

Treated with or without ivermectin

Primary outcome

All-cause in-hospital mortality

Secondary outcomes, mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, length of stay

Severe pulmonary involvement

Need for Fio2 ≥ 50%, noninvasive ventilation

Invasive ventilation

Results from reviews

N = 280

Ivermectin treated = 173

Overall mortality 15%

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 38.8%

Not given ivermectin = 107

Overall mortality 25% (OR, 0.52)

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 80.7%

No significant differences were found in extubation rates or length of stay

Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both

Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19 

Especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement

Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings

|  BLWQtT7dHGE Ivermectin and COVID 19  | Currency     | 80%         | The video was uploaded on Jan 31, 2021, and some of the documents cited go back to 2020, so the information is fairly recent. While the ivermectin discussion is ongoing, some citations in the video are now a few years old.      |
|  BLWQtT7dHGE Ivermectin and COVID 19   | Relevance    | 90%         | The video’s content is very relevant to those interested in information on the use of ivermectin for COVID-19, a controversial topic with many opinions. The video attempts to look at the issue fairly [0:00:15] without jumping to conclusions, presenting available literature.       |
|  BLWQtT7dHGE Ivermectin and COVID 19   | Authority    | 70%         | The presenter seems to be a neutral party aiming to present the data rather than giving a personal opinion [0:00:14]. He does not appear to have any medical credentials, but he does refer to authoritative sources like the British National Formulary [0:00:40] and peer-reviewed publications [0:10:02], as well as  the EVMS Critical Care COVID-19 Management Protocol [0:00:52]. |
|   BLWQtT7dHGE Ivermectin and COVID 19  | Accuracy     | 75%         | The video attempts to be accurate by presenting various sources. The presenter states he won't make claims [0:00:14], and it mostly succeeds in that, as well as showing both sides of the argument using available evidence [0:00:30].  The video shows side-effects, interactions, and limited uses [0:00:48-0:01:35], as well as the drug's standard use for parasites [0:00:49-0:01:09].  The presenter notes the need for randomized trials. [0:01:51]. However, by presenting information from the FLCCC [0:00:00:14], which is considered a controversial group, it undermines accuracy.  
|  BLWQtT7dHGE Ivermectin and COVID 19  | Purpose      | 70%         | The presenter's stated purpose is not promotional or political [0:00:15] but to present existing literature as is available and to inform [0:00:15].

## Summary of Truthfulness
This video presents a review of information regarding ivermectin use for Covid-19. The presenter appears to be attempting an objective view of the data.  While it refers to many sources, there seems to be a bias to show the positive side of the data, rather than presenting both positive and negative sides.  While many credible sources are presented, several are not peer-reviewed and come from entities with a pro-ivermectin bias.

## Recommendations for Further Metrics

The use of independent fact-checking sources would be valuable. Metrics such as the presence of statements that have been independently evaluated by organizations such as Snopes or PolitiFact might be used. Other measures to use include:

*   **Citation Analysis**: Use citation analysis to measure how many times the cited research papers or articles have been cited by other authoritative journals and medical research websites and papers.  Do the cited sources have high impact?  
*  **Bias Detection**: A tool for analyzing the bias in the video would help determine if a video is leaning one way or another, for example, a source bias towards an organization.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing user comments on the video for both negative and positive reactions would be useful.
*   **Geographic Distribution**: Tools to determine where the source is cited or shared from or where it is popular can show how it is seen around the world.
*   **Social Media Metrics**: The number of shares, views, and comments, or shares in social media platforms, to show social acceptance of the statements.
*  **Reputational Analysis**: A source credibility tool to measure the overall reputation of the sites or institutions in which the sources are cited.
