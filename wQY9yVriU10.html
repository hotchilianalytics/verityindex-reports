Why are people taking Ivermectin to treat COVID-19 even though the FDA warns against it?

There’s no clear evidence from any major study ivermectin helps treat COVID-19 and the FDA has warned against taking it.

“Not for human consumption. It says it on the bottle,” Meredith said. “It’s for deworming cattle, deworming horses.”

Many people have started taking it to treat or prevent COVID-19, despite an FDA warning titled “Why You Should Not Use Ivermectin to Treat or Prevent COVID-19&quot;. 

There is a human version of the product, but it’s not approved to treat COVID-19, because there’s no clear evidence from any major study that it helps. The poison center will now ask people where they bought it and which formula.
