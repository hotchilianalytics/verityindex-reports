| SFhlWe3BrY0 Nurse practitioner talks about using Ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients | Authority  | 60%         | The video features a nurse practitioner who is using Ivermectin in her practice. [0:01:17] However, the video also includes the perspective of the FDA and AMA [0:01:54] , who oppose Ivermectin's usage for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials.

**Summary of Truthfulness:**

This video presents a balanced view, although slightly biased in favor of Ivermectin by focusing on a practitioner who uses the drug off-label. It presents the controversy surrounding Ivermectin use for COVID-19, showcasing both the perspectives of its proponents and opponents,  with the addition of the FDA and AMA viewpoint. It clearly states that the FDA has not approved Ivermectin for this purpose. The video does not make strong claims about efficacy.  There is some bias in the video in favor of the NP, but this is balanced by clear reports of the FDA and AMA concerns.
