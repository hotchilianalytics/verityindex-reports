### Validation and Verification

| Claim | Source | Timestamp | Verification Method |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sugar consumption has gone "crazy" | graph | 0:15 | The video presents a graph of U.S. sugar consumption. |
| Sugar came from Borneo/Papua New Guinea around the 12th Century and then came to India around the 1400s, where it was made into crystals | Speaker | 0:20 | The speaker explains how sugar was processed in India and transported to Europe. Further external research into the origins of sugar would need to be performed. |
| The bodies have not adapted to sugar due to a short time in our history. The video claims that sugar is a "millisecond" in our history. | Speaker | 1:05 | The video's claims on a biological level of our evolution, the speaker posits that this causes hormone disruption, particularly relating to insulin, requires further research and reference. |
|Man is not genetically modified, but hormonally modified, mainly by Insulin, and that insulin response to food is critical. | Speaker | 1:45 | The speaker states that our bodies are now hormonally modified and gives some rationale. Claims of this sort would benefit from peer reviewed publications to confirm. |
| Calorie in Calorie out theory is incorrect. | Speaker | 2:38 | The speaker refutes the calorie-in/calorie-out theory by explaining how bodies process energy. |
| There is a link between high insulin and fat storage. | Speaker | 3:15 | The speaker claims that high insulin levels cause the body to store fat. |
| Brown fat burns energy. | Speaker | 2:46 | The speaker mentions the role of brown fat in energy burning. |
| Defining diabetes with a fasting glucose level is inaccurate. | Speaker and Table | 12:58 | The speaker references a table from an article by Kraft. J.R., where a study of glucose tolerance and insulin intolerance is given, and makes the point that fasting glucose levels alone do not define diabetes or insulin resistance. |
| 40% of diabetics had a fasting glucose \<110, 20% of diabetics had a fasting glucose < 100, and that fasting glucose is highly inaccurate. The speaker states, "it misses the majority of patients that need intervention" | Table | 13:58 | The video presents a table citing the Kraft. J.R. study, backing up the claim about the inaccuracy of using fasting glucose levels as a determination of diabetes. The table is not shown with a reference, the reference given by the speaker. |
| 2-hour + 3-hour sum of Insulin is 43 uIU/mL (normal < 60) | Table | 17:55 | The video presents a table that defines a level under 60 uIU/mL, for a 2 and 3 hour sum insulin response, as normal, and gives ranges for other blood measurements for glucose. |
| Only 16% of diabetics had a fasting insulin level of >30 so therefore a fasting insulin level is NOT a good way to diagnose Diabetes or insulin resistance. | Table and Speaker | 17:55 | The video presents the data about insulin resistance. The speaker states that these are from the Kraft. J.R. study, and thus is considered credible. |

Footnotes:

1. The speaker mentions a few sources, including a 2015 Euroaspire study (mentioned around 4:40). and mentions that insulin data was not measured in that study, but references data from Kraft. J.R. "Glucose/Insulin intolerance: A routine clinical laboratory test enhancing diabetes detection."
1. The speaker often states as fact, claims without clear references or studies to show his analysis of the claims made.

### Additional Tools for Verification and Analysis

1. **Google Scholar**: This will help in quickly looking up peer-reviewed publications on the claims being made and other related claims.
1. **PubMed Central:** PubMed Central(PMC) is a free archive of biomedical and life sciences literature. It is a good place to research and see what articles relate to the video and verify its claims.
1. **Snopes:** Snopes is a fact-checking site that could be used to verify specific claims made in the video. If a topic is popular on social media, then it might be in the snopes database of claims.
1. **Cochrane Library:** This resource can provide data from systematic reviews of medical topics, which would be a good resource for verifying medical claims.
1. **WHO (World Health Organization) Website** would have information on diabetes, heart disease, and other health conditions discussed in the video.
1. **CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Website** would have similar information to WHO, and would be a US based source of health statistics.
1. **NIH (National Institute of Health) Website:** would have information related to scientific and health research. This would add to the verification of claims, and scientific data.
1. **Data Visualization Tools:** Tools like Tableau or Google Data Studio would help visualize data on sugar consumption trends, and be used to display some of the statistics mentioned in an understandable manner.
1. **Alternative medicine tools:** Look for places such as National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health to check alternative medicine claims.
1. **Cross-referencing tools:** Using search engines to find other content that discusses this video, or similar topics, can help in determining if other people view these claims as truthful, false or misleading.

| <center>AbR1QwJwwpo Dr. Pradip Jamnadas exposes "The Bittersweet Truth"</center> | Currency   | 80%         | The video was published on Apr 27, 2020, which is a few years ago, but the information presented is still relevant to health and diet. The doctor references research from the 70s at [0:41] so it shows a historical context. |
| <center>AbR1QwJwwpo Dr. Pradip Jamnadas exposes "The Bittersweet Truth"</center> | Relevance  | 90%         | The video's main topic is the impact of sugar on health, which is highly relevant to many viewers seeking information about weight management, diabetes, and overall well-being. The discussion of the history of research in this area, including the McGovern report at [0:56], makes the material relevant to the history of diet.                                |
| <center>AbR1QwJwwpo Dr. Pradip Jamnadas exposes "The Bittersweet Truth"</center> | Authority   | 80%         | Dr. Pradip Jamnadas, MD, is presented as a qualified cardiologist with training from Yale, who has decades of experience and a professorship at two universities. The video is also part of a series of lectures from the Galen foundation, and links to additional materials on their website.                                                                 |
| <center>AbR1QwJwwpo Dr. Pradip Jamnadas exposes "The Bittersweet Truth"</center>  | Accuracy   | 75%         | While Dr. Jamnadas presents his arguments clearly and cites research, he uses the phrase "unquestionable" [0:23] which is unusual in science and medicine, where evidence is usually more nuanced. He does however show the source for this fact in the slide he presents at [0:24]. He also talks of the McGovern report as done by a single vegan [1:00] which could seem like an accusation of bias. He makes some assertions without direct evidence.   |
| <center>AbR1QwJwwpo Dr. Pradip Jamnadas exposes "The Bittersweet Truth"</center>  | Purpose   | 85%         | The purpose of the video appears to be educational, aimed at raising awareness about the impacts of sugar, carbs and fat consumption. He shares this data with some emotional appeal to action at [1:33]. The video also does promote his foundation, but this does not appear to be the main focus.    |

<br>

### Summary of Truthfulness
The video presents information about the impact of sugar on health, delivered by a qualified professional in a lecture format. The presenter appears to be giving advice he thinks is critical, as he describes "unquestionable" data, but also claims to be speaking on the viewers "behalf" by reading studies. While there may be minor issues with his delivery style and emphasis, the overall message is supported by well-known research. The video serves a valuable purpose in informing viewers about health and nutrition. He states his biases clearly.

| Dr. Stout's data from the 70s  |   [0:41]    | Dr. Jamnadas mentions Dr. Stout's research from the 70s, which he says got eclipsed by high-fat claims. This is accurate; Dr Stout's work, with the same conclusions as Dr Jamnadas, was done in that decade.  |
| McGovern Report from 1977  |   [0:56]   |  The McGovern report did come out in 1977. It was a report done by a Senate committee rather than one person who is a vegan as suggested. It did suggest that eating too much red meat was bad for the US diet, but was not a vegan report as suggested.     |
| Fat consumption reduction  |   [2:05]       | Dr. Jamnadas states that there was a "35 percent reduction in red meat consumption", and a "30 percent reduction in the amount of fats that you took in from saturated fats". This claim needs to be verified by an independent source. He cites this as a negative outcome.   |
|  High Fructose Corn Syrup      | [1:53]   |   He makes the assertion that this is very close to natural sugar, as they both contain high fructose, and so he sees no need to choose one over the other. This is his main point.   |

**Summary of Truthfulness:**
The video presents a well-structured lecture by a qualified medical professional who cites research, and the information is generally accurate. However, the content is presented from a specific point of view, advocating for a reduction in sugar, and some claims require further review and validation by medical professionals. The video is more of a scientific interpretation than a hard truth.
