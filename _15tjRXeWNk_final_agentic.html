        <h2>1. Overall Truthfulness Assessment: AssessmentLevel.LIKELYTRUE</h2>
<p>Based on the available evidence, the claims made in the video regarding Ivermectin's potential anti-cancer properties, particularly in relation to colon cancer, are likely to be true. The video accurately reflects the current state of research, which includes in vitro and in vivo studies suggesting that Ivermectin can inhibit cancer cell growth, induce apoptosis, and affect cell morphology. However, it is crucial to emphasize that these findings are preliminary and further clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects in humans. The absence of debunking videos also contributes to this assessment, although it does not guarantee complete accuracy.</p>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Scientific Evidence</strong></td>
<td>Multiple studies, including research from Henan University, support the claim that Ivermectin exhibits anti-cancer properties, specifically inhibiting the proliferation, stemness, and metastasis of colorectal cancer cells. These studies often highlight mechanisms such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, and modulation of signaling pathways like Wnt/Î²-catenin and Hippo.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong></td>
<td>The video's claims regarding Ivermectin's mechanism of action are supported by research indicating that it can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death), alter cell morphology, and interfere with cancer cell proliferation by arresting the tumor cell cycle. These effects are often linked to the modulation of specific signaling pathways within cancer cells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Historical Context</strong></td>
<td>The video's historical claims about Ivermectin's discovery and Nobel Prize are accurate. Ivermectin was indeed derived from a bacteria discovered in Japan and the scientists involved in its discovery were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 for their work on parasitic diseases.</td>

<td>Our results showed that Ivermectin (IVM) significantly inhibited cell proliferation, altered cell morphology, and induced autophagy in colon cancer cells. IVM treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of p-AKT and p-mTOR, indicating that IVM-induced autophagy is mediated by the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, we showed that IVM increased the levels of autophagy markers such as LC3II and Beclin-1. These findings suggest that IVM may be a potential therapeutic agent for colon cancer.</td>

<td>Ivermectin has demonstrated anticancer activity in various malignancies, including leukemia, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer. It exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms, including the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, suppression of angiogenesis, and modulation of the immune system. Studies have shown that ivermectin can induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells by activating caspases and disrupting mitochondrial function. It can also inhibit cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle and preventing DNA replication. Additionally, ivermectin has been found to suppress angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow and spread. Furthermore, it can modulate the immune system by enhancing the activity of immune cells, such as natural killer cells, and by suppressing the production of immunosuppressive factors.</td>

<td>Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that IVM has anticancer properties in several cancer types, including breast cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer. IVM exerts its anticancer effects through various mechanisms, including: Induction of apoptosis: IVM can trigger programmed cell death in cancer cells by activating caspases and disrupting mitochondrial function.</td>

<td>Ivermectin (IVM) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent that is used to treat several neglected tropical diseases. IVM has been revealed to possess a broad range of biological activities, including anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer effects. IVM exerts its anti-cancer effects through various mechanisms, including the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, suppression of angiogenesis, and modulation of the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the current knowledge on the biological activities of IVM and its potential therapeutic applications.</td>
