| MediaName  | MetricType  | MetricScore | Reasoning  |
| -----------| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| tLJC8hkK-ao | Currency   | 90%         | The video was uploaded in 2024, which makes it current.  |
| tLJC8hkK-ao | Relevance  | 75%         | The video aims at an audience interested in weight loss and celebrity weight-loss methods. This could be of interest to many, or could be just a clickbait method to gain attention for a new weight loss product, making it only moderately relevant.  |
| tLJC8hkK-ao | Authority  | 25%         | The video claims that Dr. Julian Ross is a renowned expert, but there are no clear sources that verify his expertise. The video does not cite any research, publications, or institutions where he works and it cites an article from 'Time' magazine on health. [0:02], the presenter states, &quot;Over 15 pounds of stubborn fat&quot; and then &quot;The case for thousands in recent months.&quot; with no evidence. [0:10]  Sarah Johnson claims &quot;I lost 39 pounds&quot; but has no credentials. [1:20] The speaker, Mark Palmer, claims Julian is an endocrinologist for 18 years and is the author of a book, but there is no evidence, which makes this low authority.|
| tLJC8hkK-ao | Accuracy   | 30%         | The video is promoting a product, and the claims about turmeric's power to induce weight loss [0:01-0:10], with claims of &quot;dissolving 15 pounds in 4 weeks&quot; is not medically supported. Furthermore, it claims it is better than Ozempic [0:28-0:31].   The presenter claims, without evidence, that it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe secret weapon behind the scenes for Hollywood's biggest stars.‚Äù [0:34-0:37] The use of stock footage for 'Sarah Johnson', 'Emily Turner', and even 'Dr. Ross', as well as the use of stock images for the pills [0:50] decreases the accuracy significantly. It references a study, but shows a screenshot without any identifying info for the publisher or date. [2:06] Furthermore the claim of Time magazine saying Julian is &quot;most relevant health expert of 2023 is not verifiable [2:12-2:16]. The before and after photos are without context [0:33-0:38, 2:16].  The claims of  &quot;44-55 pounds in 5 weeks&quot; [2:44] are also suspicious and probably false.  The claim that all this weight loss can be achieved with no change of diet, no exercise or surgery, and without medication is probably false. There is no real data or scientific study to support its claims in the video. This makes it less accurate. |
| tLJC8hkK-ao | Purpose    | 20%         | The primary purpose is to sell the Lipozem supplement with a limited-time deal and free shipping.  The entire video is framed as an interview to promote the product and to provide no-effort and easy quick weight loss using a turmeric &quot;hack&quot;.  The use of celebrity weight loss before/after photos and fake before/after testimonials increases viewership but decreases truthfulness.  The focus is solely on promoting this product at a discount price with the usual false urgency.  It is clickbait, not truthful reporting. |

### Summary of Truthfulness
The video presents a highly dubious claim about weight loss using Lipozem, relying on a 'turmeric hack' and celebrity endorsements without any solid evidence or scientific basis. There are numerous questionable claims, stock footage, lack of independent verification, and false urgency around a limited offer. These red flags make it very unlikely that the video is truthful or credible.

| Claims of celebrities using turmeric for weight loss. | 0:33-0:37                                 | 10%    | There is no proof that the claims are related to this product. The video merely shows celebrity before/after images, implying that their weight loss was due to turmeric.                                    |
|  Claim of 'Time' magazine 'health expert' for Julian  | 2:12-2:16                                | 15%   | There is no direct citation or proof that this was mentioned in Time magazine. Further investigation with Time has not discovered evidence of this claim.  |
| Claim of 34000 people using turmeric with Lipozem   |  2:19 |  20% | This claim is stated without any data to support it, and is a common clickbait method.    |
| Claim that they will sell out fast   | All time | 10% | This claim is to invoke a sales urgency, a clickbait method of getting attention to sell a product.    |
| Claim that Lipozem is better than Ozempic.  |  0:31 | 1% | This claim of Lipozem being superior to a prescription medication, without any evidence is an appeal to clickbait.  Ozempic and similar medications, while useful, should only be prescribed by licensed professionals.    |
| Claim that weight loss will occur with no diet change and no exercise. | 0:40-1:48 | 1% | Claims that weight loss with this product can occur with no diet change, or exercise, which is counter-intuitive to all accepted scientific method.  This method is promoted to gain sales.    |
| Claim that the study participants are experiencing &quot;incredible&quot; results.   | 2:41-2:49 | 1% | There is no evidence for this, and the use of the word ‚Äòincredible‚Äù with the stock footage is a clickbait method.   |
|  Claim of weight loss up to 46 pounds in 5 weeks   | 2:45  |  1% | Claims that weight loss with this product is done in an incredible short amount of time and is without evidence. This is a very risky claim that is not verifiable, and also is not a medical or scientific supported claim.  |
| Claim that pharmaceutical industry is hiding this &quot;secret&quot;    |  0:50-0:52 | 1% | This is an appeal to conspira </code></pre>
